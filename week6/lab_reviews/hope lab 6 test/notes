Remember to use 'cin.clear()' and 'cin.ignore(10000,'\n')' to avoid
cases where the error bit or old data is reused unintentionally. I can
cause an infinite loop if I put in a letter while being asked for
measurement.

You can save yourself some trouble by initializing 'string shape = ""'
as an empty string. This way you can simply check 'shape' to see if it
is empty, so you won't have to have such a complex if statement toward
the end.
